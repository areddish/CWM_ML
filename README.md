# Code With Me _ Machine Learning
Welcome to Code With Me Machine Learning Night. We will install Python, TensorFlow, and learn how to build simple Neural Networks, and how they work.

# Installing Python 
We want to install Python 3.6. We can find the latest version at Python's main website:

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-363/

We can see the different OS versions as well. For windows it is recommended that Python is installed in a new folder ex) C:\Python

## During Instillation:
It is recommend that all check boxes are checked, specifically "add Python to PATH" for Windows.

## Ensure Python is fully installed and works.
In the command line or terminal, typing ```python``` or ```python3``` should open the Python Interpreter in the command line or terminal. You can perform quick calculations to make sure it works.

```>>> 2+2```

```>>> print("Hello World")```

Typing ```>>> quit()``` exits the Python Interpreter.

# Installing PyCharm 
PyCharm is a full IDE. We can download the free community edition here:

https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/

# Pip and installing other Python Modules 
To install other Python modules we will use pip. In the command line or terminal we can type:

```> pip install [name_of_module]```

The first two modules we will install are wheel and ipython.

```> pip install wheel``` 
```> pip install ipython```
